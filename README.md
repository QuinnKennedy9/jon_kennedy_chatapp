# jon_kennedy_chatapp Setup
Clone or download the repository, run npm install for the dependencies, run node app in the root of the folder, go to localhost:3000 to view it.
Initial files committed to the master branch are the same as the ones we created in class, the styling branch was used to add a skin to the chat, notifications for when someone enters/exits, give each user a unique colour, and to give each user one of 6 unique icons when appearing in the chat
